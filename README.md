# Simple-Math-Test
A simple math test.

_How it works_

First, you will be greeted with the message, 

**"What type of math would you like to do?"**

You have four options.

0 = Addition
1 = Subtraction
2 = Multiplication
3 = Division.

One of these four numbers will be assigned to int mathType.

Anything higher than 3 will result in an error message saying, "Invalid type. Please pick a number between 0 and 3."

The console will then ask you "What is the first number"?

_Put any number you like.

The number you pick will be assigned to int firstNum.

The console will then ask you "What is the second number"?

_Again, put any number you like.

This number will be assigned to int secondNum.

Lastly, the console will say "Your answer is <firstNum (mathType) secondNum>." Again, mathType determines which arithmetic operator is used.

This is just a simple demo I did. Nothing too big. Just showing off my progress of learning C++.
